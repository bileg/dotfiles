Your login script, .xinitrc, works with startx, but graphical login managers like GDM do not look for .xinitrc. Instead, they look for a file named .xsession in your home directory. To make GDM run your .xinitrc script, you have to link it to .xsession with the following command: 

ln -s ~/.xinitrc ~/.xsession


LightDM configuration: Ubuntu 12.04 uses LightDM by default.
Create a new file /usr/share/xsessions/custom.desktop with:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Xsession
Exec=/etc/X11/Xsession

You should now have a new session option during login, Xsession will load the user's ~/.xsession file
