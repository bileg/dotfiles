Ion 3

Copy /etc/X11/ion3/cfg_bindings.lua to ~/.ion3/cfg_bindings.lua (if you did not do this already) and edit it. By using kpress(KEY, ACTION) you can bind actions to multimedia keys:
File: ~/.ion3/cfg_bindings.lua

bdoc("Mute/Unmute Sound."),
kpress("AnyModifier+XF86AudioMute", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'amixer sset Master toggle')"),
bdoc("Increase Volume."),
kpress("AnyModifier+XF86AudioRaiseVolume", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'amixer sset Master 3%+')"),
bdoc("Decrease Volume."),
kpress("AnyModifier+XF86AudioLowerVolume", "ioncore.exec_on(_, 'amixer sset Master 3%-')"),
....

Note that in some later versions of ion3, key bindings have moved from cfg_bindings.lua to cfg_ioncore.lua. Same syntax, just a different file. If you don't have an /etc/X11/ion3/cfg_bindings.lua to copy, this is probably why.
