Welcome to Notion!

If you have never used Notion before, it is highly recommended that you study 
the Notion manual page before proceeding further. It is reproduced below, but 
you can also access it later on, for example, by pressing <F1> and then 
<Enter> or, by running 'man notion' in a terminal. All this supposing that 
you have installed Notion in a standard location so that the system commands
can find the manual page.

If you are too eager to try out Notion and against all recommendation want to
skip reading the manual page, you should at least know that pressing <F2> 
should start a terminal emulator (xterm) and that the main menu can be 
accessed with <F12>.

When you feel ready to write customized configuration files (you're going
to do that in any case), please see the configuration manual available from
the Notion webpage listed at the end of the user manual below. It may, however,
be beneficial to become well acquainted with Notion before delving into this 
so that you have grasped the basic concepts necessary to understand the
binding configuration files.

NOTION(1)                   General Commands Manual                  NOTION(1)



NAME
       Notion - an X11 window manager

SYNOPSIS
       notion [options]

DESCRIPTION
       Notion  is  a tiling tabbed window manager designed with keyboard users
       in mind.


OPTIONS
       -display host:display.screen
              X display to manage

       -conffile configfile
              Configuration file to use instead of default

       -searchdir dir
              Directory to search for configuration files and other scripts

       -oneroot
              On X servers with multiple (traditional  non-Xinerama)  screens,
              manage  only  default screen (root window), not all, as given by
              the -display option or in the DISPLAY environment variable.

       -session session_name
              Set session name. This option affects where workspace and  other
              save files are put (~/.notion/session_name if option set).

       -version
              Show version

       -about Show about text (version, author, license)


BASIC CONCEPTS
       This  section  is  an overview of the types objects that appear on an X
       display managed by Notion and their relationships in a standard  setup.
       This  information  is necessary to understand the operations and avail-
       ability of the different key  bindings  explained  below.  For  a  more
       detailed  explanation, needed for writing custom bindings configuration
       files, see the additional documentation available from the  Notion  Web
       page.

       The  top-level  objects  that  matter  in the case at hand are screens.
       They correspond to physical screens. Screens contain workspaces  (which
       are  a  kind  of  group), and client windows put into full screen mode.
       These objects are multiplexed in the sense that only one  can  be  dis-
       played at a time.

       Workspaces themselves may contain tilings and detached/floating frames.
       A workspace containing no tilings and only detached/floating windows is
       also  called  a  floating  workspace. Tilings themselves contain frames
       tiled to fill the screen, and possibly a statusbar  or  dock.  Akin  to
       screens, frames multiplex other objects, but in this case mostly client
       window groups. Most of the time, frames are the only  trace  of  Notion
       you  see  on  the  screen. Frames may have border decorations, and they
       have a tab for each multiplexed object.

       Queries are boxes that appear at the bottoms of frames  or  screens  to
       ask  you  for  textual  input  to execute an action that depends on it.
       Most queries support tab-completion.



BINDINGS
       These are the default key and pointer bindings. Below, Mod4  refers  to
       the  modifier used by Notion. Mod4 is the default, but this can be con-
       figured by setting META in the configuration. The particular  key  that
       is interpreted as Mod4 depends on your system. On Xorg-based systems it
       is usually bound to the windows key. The xmodmap(1x) tool can  be  used
       to  get/set  which  key  codes  correspond  to which modifiers, and the
       xev(1x) tool can be used to see what codes are generated by  particular
       keys.

       The string in square brackets after a binding group heading below indi-
       cates the module whose configuration file defines these bindings.
